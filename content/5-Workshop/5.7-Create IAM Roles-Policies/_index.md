## Goal

This section explains how **IAM roles and policies** are designed for the English Journey application.

Most roles are generated by **AWS Amplify**, but we still need to understand:

- which roles exist,
- what each role is allowed to do (S3, DynamoDB, SES, MediaConvert, …),
- and how we apply the **least-privilege** principle.

## 5.7.1 Overview of IAM in the architecture

In the architecture from sections 5.3–5.6, IAM is the glue that connects services:

- **Amplify** uses IAM roles to deploy CloudFormation stacks and host the frontend.
- **Lambda** functions use execution roles to access DynamoDB, S3 and SES (for sending emails).
- **CloudWatch** and **SES** rely on IAM so alarms and email notifications can be sent correctly.

The design goal is that *each component only receives the minimum permissions it needs*.

## 5.7.2 Lambda execution roles

When we define backend functions in Amplify (Level Test, My Learning, Dictionary, Vocabulary, …), Amplify automatically creates a **Lambda execution role** for each function.

Each role has:

- **Trust policy** – allows the Lambda service to assume the role:

  ```json
  {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": { "Service": "lambda.amazonaws.com" },
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
  }
